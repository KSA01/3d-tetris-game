# 3d-game

How to play the game:

Objective: Try to rotate the pieces as they fall so that they complete a row of blocks in any direction and once one axis row is filled it will dissapear and add 1 point to your tally. Keep playing the game until you lose by allowing a block to go above the border limit and your final score is calculated.

- Use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to move the pieces position
- Use the "A", "S", and "D" keys to rotate the falling piece
- Use the "I", "J", "K", and "L" keys to rotate the camera view
- Hold the "Enter" key to speed up the piece drop
